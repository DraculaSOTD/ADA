# Rules Engine Button Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Add Condition Button Not Working
**Problem**: The "Add Condition" button click event was lost when `renderConditions()` replaced the HTML.

**Solution**: Added the missing event listener in `attachConditionEventListeners()`:
```javascript
// Add condition button
const addConditionBtn = document.getElementById('add-condition-btn');
if (addConditionBtn) {
    addConditionBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
        this.addCondition(this.ruleData.conditions);
        this.renderConditions();
    });
}
```

### 2. Add Action Button Not Working
**Problem**: Similar to conditions, the "Add Action" button event was lost during re-renders.

**Solution**: Added the event listener in `attachActionEventListeners()`:
```javascript
// Add action button
const addActionBtn = document.getElementById('add-action-btn');
if (addActionBtn) {
    addActionBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
        this.addAction();
        this.renderActions();
    });
}
```

### 3. Trigger Type Selector
**Problem**: The trigger type dropdown lost its event listener when triggers were re-rendered.

**Solution**: Created `attachTriggerTypeListener()` method and called it after rendering triggers.

### 4. Root Conditions Group ID
**Problem**: The root conditions group didn't have an ID, which could cause issues with the condition tree.

**Solution**: Added `id: 'root'` to the initial conditions structure.

## How Conditions Work

When you add a condition, it creates a structure like:
```javascript
{
    id: 'condition_0',
    type: 'condition',
    field: '',          // User selects from dropdown (e.g., 'api.input.userId')
    operator: 'equals', // User selects operator (equals, greater_than, etc.)
    value: ''          // User enters the comparison value
}
```

The UI renders:
1. **Field dropdown**: Shows available fields including API input fields
2. **Operator dropdown**: Shows comparison operators (equals, not_equals, greater_than, etc.)
3. **Value input**: Text field for entering the comparison value
4. **Remove button**: To delete the condition

## How Actions Work

When you add an action, it creates:
```javascript
{
    id: 'action_0',
    type: 'trigger_model',  // User selects action type
    config: {}              // Configuration specific to action type
}
```

Available action types:
- Trigger Model
- Send Notification
- Call Webhook
- Store Data
- Transform Data
- Conditional Action
- Loop Over Data
- Trigger Another Rule

## Testing

The buttons should now:
1. **Add Condition**: Creates a new condition row with field selector, operator, and value input
2. **Add Action**: Creates a new action with type selector and configuration options
3. **Add Group**: Creates a new condition group with AND/OR operator
4. All buttons maintain their functionality after re-renders
